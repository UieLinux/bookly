Bookly
===
Bookly is aimed to people who wants to sell, buy or donate their books.
 
Bookly does not handle the sale of the books.
This is not his goal.
The purpose of the program is to simplify the match between demand and offer putting in contact
the interested people in the easiest way possible.

Key features
---
Just registered, an user can do 3 things.

1. Compile a list of books to offer (or sell)
2. Compile a list of books to search (or buy)
2. Do a search for a specific book

### Books that i offer
The user compile a list of books, he want to offer
by giving specific informations:

* ISBN (obligatory)
* Titolo (obligatory)
* Author
* Note
* Status of the book (new, battered, ecc.)

### Books i look for
As the previous function, i have to compile
a list of books i want to get
In this case, just the following data:

* ISBN (obbligatory)
* Expiration date (beyond which i am no longer interested)
* Note
 
### Books search
This function allows users to show a list of all the books in the archive.
Both those offered that sought.
After viewing the list, the user clicks on the book's details and sees the owner data.
This mode allows you to contact the person who provides the books without going through the  match feature.

### Automatic match
The match between the offer and demand needs to be done independently by the program.
It is possible that the books the user is looking for, are inserted after the search.
When the program finds a match between offer and demand an email will be sent to the 2 interested.

Ideas for the future
---
In a next version, some automatisms will be added, in order to semplify the user functions, like:

1. If a user has already inserted a book, the program can detect this and automatically propose the description
2. With the ISB code is possible to extract the cover of the book from sites like amazon
3. <s>Adding a check on the ISBN (it must be valid)</s>
4. Bookly will be internationalized
5. Will be possible to insert your origins of belonging (Example: province)
6. A book must have a function to be able to put it in the books available for sale or deleted
7. Create a virtual currency for the selling / buying of the books
8. Every purchase that is done generates a donation
9. Scan the barcode by mobile phone / webcam for a faster insertion of the books in the lists
